PHP Server Benchmark
=====================

## What is this?

PHP Server Benchmark is a simple to use benchmark for PHP webservers.
This means that you can use it to measure the speed of your webserver.

It tests many parts of PHP, like string functions, array functions, filesystem functions and more.

## Installation

To install it, simply copy all files of this repository to your webspace and go to the `index.php`.

It needs **at least PHP 5** and **write permssions** in the installation folder and in the `libs/` subfolder.

## Usage

To start the tests, simply click on 'Start' and all tests will be executed by default 5 times.
You can change the execution number in the settings menu.

## Export

You can save your results by enabling export it in the settings menu.

Note that you must enable it *before* you start the tests you want to save.

At the moment you can only export to CSV (Comma-Separated Values).
